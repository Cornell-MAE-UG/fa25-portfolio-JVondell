The device was composed of four containers; two containers of liquid water and two empty containers. One of the water containers had ice water, placed in a refrigerating bag to keep it cool, and this acted as our cold reservoir. Blue food coloring was added to this water bath to denote that it was the cold bath. The other container, which acted as our hot reservoir, had warm water warmed up by an immersion heating device and was colored with red food coloring to denote it as our hot bath. Each of these containers also had a water pump connected to tubes which linked them to a heat exchanger, while the heat exchanger was connected to two other tubes that each rest in one of the empty containers. The liquid flows through the tubes, into the heat exchangers, and out into the empty containers as the setup is connected to power through the pumps.

The following includes a system diagram and relevant equations:

A possible design change for this could be to increase the mass flow rate of the cooling water by increasing pump speed or using a larger pump. This would increase the overall heat transfer coefficient, and thus raises the total heat transfer rate, Q, which reduces the hot-side outlet temperature. It should be noted that this change would mean better heat transfer, but higher energy consumption.
